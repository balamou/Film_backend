title: The Hangover
year: "2009"
plot: Angelenos Doug Billings and Tracy Garner are about to get married. Two days
  before the wedding, the four men in the wedding party - Doug, Doug's two best
  buddies Phil Wenneck and Stu Price, and Tracy's brother Alan Garner - hop into
  Tracy's father's beloved Mercedes convertible for a 24-hour stag party to Las
  Vegas. Phil, a married high school teacher, has the same maturity level as his
  students when he's with his pals. Stu, a dentist, is worried about everything,
  especially what his controlling girlfriend Melissa thinks. Because she
  disapproves of traditional male bonding rituals, Stu has to lie to her about
  the stag, he telling her that they are going on a wine tasting tour in the
  Napa Valley. Regardless, he intends on eventually marrying her, against the
  advice and wishes of his friends. And Alan seems to be unaware of what are
  considered the social graces of the western world. The morning after their
  arrival in Las Vegas, they awaken in their hotel suite each with the worst
  hangover. None remembers what happened in the past twelve or so hours. The
  suite is in shambles. And certain things are in the suite that shouldn't be,
  and certain things that should be in the suite are missing. Probably the most
  important in the latter category is Doug. As Phil, Stu and Alan try to find
  Doug using only what little pieces of information they have at hand, they go
  on a journey of discovery of how certain things got into the suite and what
  happened to the missing items. However they are on a race for time as if they
  can't find Doug in the next few hours, they are going to have to explain to
  Tracy why they are not yet back in Los Angeles. And even worse, they may not
  find Doug at all before the wedding.
