title: Iron Man
year: "2008"
plot: Tony Stark. Genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist. Son of legendary
  inventor and weapons contractor Howard Stark. When Tony Stark is assigned to
  give a weapons presentation to an Iraqi unit led by Lt. Col. James Rhodes,
  he's given a ride on enemy lines. That ride ends badly when Stark's Humvee
  that he's riding in is attacked by enemy combatants. He survives - barely -
  with a chest full of shrapnel and a car battery attached to his heart. In
  order to survive he comes up with a way to miniaturize the battery and figures
  out that the battery can power something else. Thus Iron Man is born. He uses
  the primitive device to escape from the cave in Iraq. Once back home, he then
  begins work on perfecting the Iron Man suit. But the man who was put in charge
  of Stark Industries has plans of his own to take over Tony's technology for
  other matters.
