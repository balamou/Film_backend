  title: Westworld
  year: 2016–
  plot: Westworld isn't your typical amusement park. Intended for rich vacationers,
    the futuristic park allows its visitors to live out their most primal
    fantasies with the robotic "hosts." However, the robotic hosts have evolved
    an artificial consciousness that is similar to, yet diverges from, human
    consciousness. No matter how illicit the fantasy may be, there are no
    consequences for the park's guests, allowing for any wish to be indulged;
    but there is a price to be paid.
