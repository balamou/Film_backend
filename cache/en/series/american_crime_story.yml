  year: 2016â€“
  plot: "The People v. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story is a limited series that
    takes you inside the O.J. Simpson trial with a riveting look at the legal
    teams battling to convict or acquit the football legend of double homicide.
    Based on the book The Run of His Life: The People v. O.J. Simpson by Jeffrey
    Toobin, it explores the chaotic behind-the-scenes dealings and maneuvering
    on both sides of the court, and how a combination of prosecution
    overconfidence, defense shrewdness, and the LAPD's history with the city's
    African-American community gave a jury what it needed: reasonable doubt."
